# Not a black box

*Slide 31 of 37 — template_template pitch, medium deck — kind: `content`*

- 25 importable subpackages, 696 tracked Python files total under infrastructure/ — a real inventory anyone can `git ls-files` themselves, not a claimed abstraction.
- The largest single subpackage, core, holds 113 files — still a minority of the whole, not a monolith wearing a modular label.
- Every number on this slide is computed live by src/infra_facts.py at render time, reusing the exact same counters docs/_generated/COUNTS.md is built from.
- The chart on the next slide shows a slightly narrower total — it only counts files inside an importable subpackage, excluding 2 top-level file(s) (infrastructure/__init__.py, mcp_server.py) that do not belong to any subpackage.
